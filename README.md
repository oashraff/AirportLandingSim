# Welcome to the AirportLandingSimulator repository!

- This project wouldn't have been possible without the hard work and dedication of me and my amazing team members, Aly Elaswad and Ahmed Abdeen. I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to each one of them.
- The main objective of this project was to estimate the average wait time of the airplanes remaining airborne until they land on the runway after it is free.
